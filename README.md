# Router Suspense

A suspense-friendly minimalistic sister of React Router.

For demonstration purposes only. For now. :-)

```
npm i router-suspense
```

You will need to enable suspense. That means either building React yourself. Or, using this handy dandy starter we made.

## Inspiration

A lot of this code is taken straight from React Router and React Training's MiniRouter lecture.
